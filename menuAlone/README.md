Showcase Script:
  **PREPARE TO SHOWCASE DEFAULT ESX.MENU REPLACEMENT**
  Hello, and welcome to the SSmenuAlone, or "menuAlone" showcase. 
  menuAlone is a resource used to provide servers with a fully native, and if desired, client customizable menu system.
  **OPEN TOP-LEFT ALIGNED MENU**
  As well as fully native functionality, allowing menuAlone to be completely standalone, it uses direct conversions from ESX.Menu so changing systems
  and creating new menus is as easy as possible. menuAlone contains the same alignment system as ESX.Menu with a few special inclusions.
  **OPEN ADJUSTMAOPS MENU**
  Understanding the saying "different strokes for different folks", I'm a firm believer that client UIs should be adjustable for themselves,
  so config options and the 'custom' menu alignment option allow players to customize their menu font, position, scale, and even the options draw limit giving them a bit of control for
  recording and streaming setups.
  **ADJUST FONT SETTING**
  Fonts are selectable in the config to allow users who add or replace fonts to allow any font usable with SetFontText to be selected for the menu text.
  **ADJUST X POSITION SETTING**
  X positions scale across the clients screen from 0 to 1,
  **ADJUST Y POSITION SETTING**
  Y positions scale down the clients screen from 0 to 1, and
  **ADJUST SCALE SETTING**
  Scale value is adjustable to increase or decrease the size of the menu and text.
  **ADJUST LIMIT SETTING**
  The final option, limit, is designed to allow clients to adjust the total displayed menu elements, letting players choose how many options they will see in their menus.
